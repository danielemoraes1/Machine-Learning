    "### Project Objective\n",
    "The objective of this project is to identify country profiles with distinct health and public spending patterns through the application of clustering techniques. Using a dataset that includes socio-economic and health-related indicators such as *Life expectancy, Adult mortality, Alcohol consumption, Health expenditure, GDP, Population, Education level, and Infectious disease coverage (Hepatitis B, Polio, Diphtheria), the goal is to uncover groups of countries that share similar characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The clustering will be performee by K-Means and Hierarchical, preceded by PCA to reduce dimensionality and improve interpretability of the cluster structures. Through analysis of clustering solution and  using the Silhouette Score and Davies–Bouldin Index, It will be possible a quantitative comparison of algorithm performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The insights generated can help understand how economic and social factors align with population health outcomes globally."
